Some utilities for working with HP 4195A vector / spectrum / network analyzer.

Any code found here is licensed under GPLv3.

The most useful is probably `dumpscreen.py` , to retrieve screenshots remotely over GPIB. It uses pyvisa and any of a variety of supported backends.

Eventually I want to expand this script to improve / automate file naming, plot caption, and conversion to more modern graphical phormats.
